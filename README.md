The REST API is implemented using the Java Spring framework. The database is a NoSQL MongoDB database hosted remotely on Atlas.
The application retrieves current stock price information from the IEX Cloud service API and uses that information to manage client portfolios in real-time. 
Clients can fund their accounts, buy & sell securities and view their portfolio details for a selected time period using the /transaction endpoint.

The application has a suite of unit and integration tests. All of which are currently passing. Token-based Security has been fully implemented: 
Ten (10) Unit tests for the Database services
Thirteen (13) Integration tests for the controllers and database services

The details of the implementation are as follows:
